<blockquote>
<p><i>High in a cliff cavity stands Montezuma Castle, a prehistoric Indian dwelling so perfectly
preserved that ceiling timbers in many of the rooms are still intact</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montezuma Castle National
Monument, in the Verde Valley
of central Arizona, protects one
of the best preserved and most interesting
cliff dwellings in the United States. Within
the monument, occupying part of a limestone
cliff which borders Beaver Creek for half a
mile, are the ruins of several prehistoric Indian
house clusters. Among them is the large
structure called Montezuma Castle, which is
about 90 percent intact and original.</p>
<h3 id="c1"><i>The Environment</i></h3>
<p>The Verde Valley of central Arizona is
bordered on the north and east by the great
plateau of northeastern Arizona and on the
southwest by the Black Hills. Through the
level floor of the valley winds the Verde
River, fed by Beaver Creek and several other
tributaries.</p>
<p>Several million years ago the mouth of
this valley was dammed by a lava flow from
Arizona&rsquo;s volcanic Black Hills. The impounded
waters formed a lake 35 miles long
and 18 miles wide. In it, streams feeding
the lake deposited enormous quantities of
limy mud. Perhaps by 2 million years ago,
the overflow from the imprisoned waters had
worn down the lava dam so that eventually
the lake was drained. Subsequently, the
Verde River and its tributaries cut channels
through the now dry and hardened lime
deposits of the old lake bed. Since then,
much of the limestone bordering these
streams has been eroded away, thus broadening
their valleys.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>The Early Inhabitants</i></h3>
<p>Scant archeological evidence so far available
indicates human beings were living in
the Verde Valley over a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>These were industrious, sedentary Indians
from southern Arizona who settled on the
fertile river terraces and began farming.
They lived a distinctly rural life, with no
cities or large centers of population, in little
villages of one-room, pole-and-brush houses.</p>
<p>These farm folk probably lived in comparative
peace in the valley until about the
beginning of the 12th century. After 1100,
another group of farm Indians entered the
valley from the north. These people constructed
communal dwellings, or pueblos,
which after A. D. 1250 were converted into
large compact defensible structures.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>Beginnings of Montezuma Castle</i></h3>
<p>The majority of these Indians concentrated
into larger settlements for protection.
They built their pueblos on the hilltops near
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
their fields, for here were the most convenient
sites. Tuzigoot National Monument,
2 miles east of Clarkdale, Ariz., provides an
excellent example of these hilltop locations.
Occasionally, a suitable location was found
in a cliff.</p>
<p>It can be imagined with what enthusiasm a
band of the farmers might have first noticed,
on the north bank of Beaver Creek, only 4
miles from the Verde River, a great cavern-pitted
limestone cliff, well over 100 feet high.
This was an ideal spot for a dwelling site,
with good farmland nearby on the creek
terrace. Here they began building rooms to
accommodate their needs. We find that in a
quarter-mile strip of cliff there were two distinct
apartment houses. Growth during several
generations made one of these villages a
5-story structure with 45 rooms. A hundred
yards east was a 5-story structure with 20
rooms, which was destined, centuries later, to
be inaccurately called Montezuma Castle.</p>

<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="729" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Montezuma Castle rises above the model which explains its history</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c4"><i>The Classic Period</i></h3>
<p>These dwellings were occupied until about
A. D. 1400. As many as 200 persons may
well have lived in the several house clusters.
The castle could have accommodated 12 or
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
15 families (possibly 50 people). These cliff
dwellers lived through the peak period of
Pueblo culture, producing stone implements,
excellent turquoise and shell jewelry, cotton
cloth (some of it elaborately decorated),
sturdily constructed baskets, and many other
objects.</p>
<p>The pottery made locally, at Montezuma
Castle and in the Verde Valley generally,
consisted mainly of plain brown or red ware.
The prehistoric people of the Verde, although
apparently highly talented along certain
other lines, seem never to have developed a
really ornamental painted pottery of their
own. Instead, they acquired decorated pottery
from the north by trade with the Flagstaff
area and the Hopi country.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Abandonment</i></h3>
<p>There seem to have been several reasons
for the abandonment of Montezuma Castle
and other pueblos in nearby areas. Those in
the Flagstaff area, about 50 miles to the
north, underwent depopulation sometime in
the 1200&rsquo;s, possibly as a result of a century
of recurring droughts. There was continuous
drought for 23 years, from 1276-99. It is
thought that many of these people moved
southward into the Verde Valley which during
this period showed an increase in population.</p>
<p>During this same period, the dry farmers
on the desert flats of the Verde Valley moved
to the banks of the spring-fed streams. Here
irrigation was practiced by others in the small
acreage available along the streams. This
combination of small farming acreage and a
concentration of population may have led to
interpueblo strife; and this in turn contributed
to a gradual exodus from the Verde
Valley. By the late 1300&rsquo;s the pueblos in the
Verde Valley were overpopulated for the
available farmland and food supply. Montezuma
Castle was probably abandoned during
the first part of the 1400&rsquo;s, since no trade
pottery dating after that time has been found.</p>
<p>A number of the cliff dwellers must have
gone into northern Arizona to join the
friendly Hopi, with whom they had long
established trade relations. Modern Hopi
traditions still indicate some ancestral origins
in the Verde Valley.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>Montezuma Well</i></h3>
<p>Another example of prehistoric Indian
work can be seen at Montezuma Well, a detached
part of Montezuma Castle National
Monument, 7 miles by road northeast of the
Castle. This area contains a large limestone
sink, half filled with water which continually
flows out at the rate of 1,500,000 gallons
a day. The Indians, who constructed
their small cliff dwellings and pueblos
around this well, diverted the water into irrigation
ditches which carried it to their farmlands
below. These ditches are visible today
because they were cemented up by the lime
content of the water which flowed through
them. The story of the Indians at Montezuma
Well is similar to that at Montezuma Castle.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>How To Reach the Monument</i></h3>
<p>Montezuma Castle is 5 miles north of
Camp Verde, 60 miles south of Flagstaff, and
65 miles east of Prescott. It may be reached
by U. S. 89 Alternate from Flagstaff via Oak
Creek Canyon and Sedona, or by the same
highway from Prescott through Jerome,
Clarkdale, and Cottonwood, then on a State
road through Cornville. It may also be
reached by State Routes 69 and 79 from
Phoenix, 95 miles to the south.</p>
<p>Another approach from the south is the
graveled road from Roosevelt Dam, via Payson,
Pine, and Camp Verde.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>About Your Visit</i></h3>
<p>You will find small museums at both Montezuma
Castle and Montezuma Well, to help
you understand the area and its history. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
monument is open daily from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m.
There are very limited picnic facilities
in both sections.</p>
<p>The nominal admission fee is waived for
children under 12 years of age.</p>

<h3 id="c9"><i>Mission 66</i></h3>
<p>Mission 66 is a program designed to be
completed by 1966 which will assure the
maximum protection of the scenic, scientific,
wilderness, and historic resources of the
National Park System in such ways and by
such means as will make them available for
the use and enjoyment of present and future
generations.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><i>Administration</i></h3>
<p>Montezuma Castle National Monument is
administered by the National Park Service
of the U. S. Department of the Interior. It
was established by Presidential proclamation
in 1906 and contains 783 acres in 2 sections.
A superintendent, whose address is Camp
Verde, Ariz., is in immediate charge.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
